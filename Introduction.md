### Leaflet 

Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for interactive web maps. It's lightweight, simple, and flexible, and is probably the most popular open-source mapping library at the moment. Leaflet is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin (currently of MapBox) and other contributors.

Leaflet creates "Slippy" maps with tiled base layers, panning and zooming, and feature layers that you supply. It handles various basic tasks like converting data to map layers and mouse interactions, and it's easy to extend with plugins. It will also work well across most types of devices. 

### Making maps and graphs with d3
D3 is a open JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven')documents, which are web-based(HTML and SVG). Bringing to life your data using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source and free available at Github. With D3, you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your date but also: a map!

On the website of D3 you can find beautiful examples. Be inspired and have a look at their code! https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery

### Preparation

On your computer create a directory for yourself, where we can work in today. For example:

	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_Leaflet
	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_D3

In these directories we save everything we make and download today. During this workshop it is referred to as `yourDirectory`.

### Let's start!  
If you already know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can start immediately with the tutorial at **[[Leaflet step 1 ]]** and read through the HTML explanations. 

If you are not that comfortable with it yet, this **[[Making a web page ]]** tutorial will help you along!
