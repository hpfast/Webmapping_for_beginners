With leaflet you can make interactive web maps for all devices. Leaflet is made by Vladimir Agafonkin and is an open source JavaScript library. So free to use.

### Making maps and graphs with d3
D3 is a open JavaScript library. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven')documents, which are web-based(HTML and SVG). D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source and free available at Github. With D3, you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your date but also: a map!

On the website of D3 you can find beautiful examples. Be inspired and have a look at their code! https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery

### Preparation

On your computer create a directory for yourself, where we can work in today. For example:

	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_Leaflet
	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_D3

In these directories we save everything we make and download today. During this workshop it is referred to as `yourDirectory`.

### Let's start!  
If you already know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can start immediately with the tutorial at [[Leaflet step 1 ]] and read through the HTML explanations. 

If you are not that comfortable with it yet, this [[Making a web page ]] tutorial will help you along!
