## Short outline

JavaScript powers most on-line maps these days. During this workshop we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries D3.js and Leaflet.js.
We'll start off with a brief introduction into making web pages. To eventually spend most of our time on learning the tools of the trade.

1. [[Introduction Leaflet]]
1. HTML, CSS and JS [[Making a web page]]
2. Leaflet.js Basics [[Leaflet step 1]] [[Leaflet step 2]]
2. Leaflet.js Advanced [[Leaflet step 3]]
2. [[Introduction D3]]
2. D3.js Basics [[D3 step 1]]
2. D3.js Advanced [[D3 step 2]]
3. [[Hosting on Github]]

## Goal 

At the end of this workshop, you will have your own web page with an interactive map! Including some custom data and different background maps, zoomed in on the area you want to show! Your web page will be hosted on Github, so you can immediately share your progress of the day with all your family and friends!
