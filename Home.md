Webmapper is a cartographic development and consultancy company based in Utrecht, the Netherlands. -They make geographic applications for the web with special attention for web-cartography. 

## Short outline

JavaScript powers most on-line maps these days. During this workshop we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries D3.js and Leaflet.js. This workshop will start from the very beginning! Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! This workshop will help get you started. 
Therefore we'll start off with a brief introduction into making web pages in general. To eventually spend most of our time on learning the tools of the trade.

1. [[Introduction Leaflet]]
1. HTML, CSS and JS [[Making a web page]]
2. Leaflet.js Basics [[Leaflet step 1]] [[Leaflet step 2]]
2. Leaflet.js Advanced [[Leaflet step 3]]
2. [[Introduction D3]]
2. D3.js Basics [[D3 step 1]]
2. D3.js Advanced [[D3 step 2]]
3. [[Hosting on Github]]

## Goal 

At the end of this workshop, you will have your own web page with an interactive map! Including some custom data and different background maps, zoomed in on the area you want to show! Your web page will be hosted on Github, so you can immediately share your progress of the day with all your family and friends!

## What do you need?

Your laptop with:

* a web browser, like Firefox, Chrome or Safari.
* a proper text editor, like [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) with [Syntax Highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).
* a Github account. Create one at [www.github.com](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).
* internet.

>### Syntax Highlighting
>
> Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or mark-up languages, such as HTML. It displays text, especially source code, in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms to make them more visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.
