## Welcome to the workshop: Webmapping for beginners!

## Goal of today
At the end of this workshop, you will have your own web page with an interactive map! Including some custom data and different background maps, zoomed in on the area you want to show! Your web page will be hosted on Github, so you can immediately share your progress of the day with all your family and friends!



### Leaflet 
With leaflet you can make interactive web maps for all devices. Leaflet is made by Vladimir Agafonkin and is an open source JavaScript library. So free to use. If you already know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can start immediately and read through the HTML explanations. If you are not that comfortable with it yet, this tutorial will help you along!

### Making maps and graphs with d3
D3 is a open JavaScript library. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven')documents, which are web-based(HTML and SVG). D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source and free available at Github. With D3, you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your date but also: a map!

On the website of D3 you can find beautiful examples. Be inspired and have a look at their code! https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery
