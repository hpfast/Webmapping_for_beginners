### Uploading files

1. Upload all the files you need for your web map

### Hosting with gh-pages

Github has this awesome trick! If we change our main branch to a Github Pages branch and put a `index.html` file in there, github will host our website!

1. Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
2. Then select the master branch source and click on the Save button.

Let's edit our README.md in the browser to customize it! 

2. Click on the README.md file and edit it by clicking the edit button.

	~~~
	# My First Web Map in Leaflet.js
