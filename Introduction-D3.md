### Making maps and graphs with d3
D3 is a open JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven')documents, which are web-based(HTML and SVG). Bringing to life your data using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source and free available at Github. With D3, you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your date but also: a map!

### Preparation

On your computer create a directory for yourself, where we can work in today. For example:

	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_D3

In these directories we save everything we make and download today. During this workshop it is referred to as `yourDirectory`.
