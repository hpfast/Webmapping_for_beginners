### Making maps and graphs with d3
D3 is a open JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven')documents, which are web-based(HTML and SVG). Bringing to life your data using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source and free available at Github. With D3, you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your data but also: a map!

On the website of D3 you can find beautiful examples. Be inspired and have a look at their code! https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery

In short, D3.js takes in some data and makes a graphic out of it, be it a chart or a map, using [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). 

> ### SVG
> SVG is a text-based vecotr image format for two-dimensional graphics. Meaning, you can specify what an SVG image should look like by writing simple markup code, sort of like HTML tags. In fact, SVG code can be included directly within any HTML document. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, as well as with drawing software.

This can be quite convienient if your data changes. You can easily prepare your graphics with dummy data. So when the actual data arrives, D3.js re-creates the graphic as the data comes in. SVG is rendered in the browser. If many people try to access a item, the graphics don't weigh much into the IT infrastructure. Also SVG is scalable. Using mobile phones or tablest with all sorts of screen sizes. The graphics can easily scale up and down without losing their sharpness.

In [[D3 step 1]] we will set up the basics to show a simple map with D3.
In [[D3 step 2]] 

### Preparation

:arrow_forward:  On your computer create a directory for yourself, where we can work in today. For example:

	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_D3

In these directories we save everything we make and download today. During this workshop it is referred to as `yourDirectory`.

### Let's start!  
:arrow_right: If you are not that comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript yet, this **[[Making a web page ]]** tutorial will help you along!

:arrow_right: If you already know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can start immediately with the tutorial at **[[D3 step 1 ]]** and read through the HTML explanations.
