### Making maps and graphs with d3
D3 is a open JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. The data you provide yourself. D3 makes the connection between your data and the ('driven')documents, which are web-based(HTML and SVG). Bringing to life your data using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3.js is developed by Mike Bostock and completely open source and free available at Github. With D3, you can make beautiful interactive visualizations, graphs of your date but also: a map!

On the website of D3 you can find beautiful examples. Be inspired and have a look at their code! https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery


Mike Bostock started D3.js whilst working at Stanford University. In short, D3.js takes in some data and makes a graphic out of it, be it a chart or a map, using [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). It's great for online newspapers:

* SVG is rendered in the browser. If many people try to access a news item, the graphics don't weigh much into the newspaper's IT infrastructure.
* SVG is scalable. Typically, people check the news when they are on the go. They use their mobile phones with all sorts of screen sizes. The graphics can easily scale up and down without losing their sharpness.
* It's data-driven: you can easily prepare your graphics with dummy data. So when the actual news happens or an embargo is lifted, D3.js re-creates the graphic as the data comes in.

Actually, everyone creating graphics can benefit from these advantages! So let's look at some clever optimisations.

### Preparation

On your computer create a directory for yourself, where we can work in today. For example:

	/home/niene/Documents/MyFirstWebMap_D3

In these directories we save everything we make and download today. During this workshop it is referred to as `yourDirectory`.

### Let's start!  
If you are not that comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript yet, this **[[Making a web page ]]** tutorial will help you along!

If you already know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can start immediately with the tutorial at **[[Leaflet step 1 ]]** and read through the HTML explanations.
