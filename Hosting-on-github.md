1. Head over to GitHub and create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) named myfirstwebmap 

![](img/create_repro.png)

2. Give your repository a nice description. Like:

	My First Web Map in Leaflet.js

2. Setting: `Public`

2. Initialize this repository with a README.md

4. Create Repository

Now we have our own repository!

### Uploading files

1. Upload all the files you need for your web map

- index.html
- style/main.css
- js/main.js
- data.json

Make sure you put your main.css in a folder called style! 
You can do this by uploading the main.css and then edit it. Type in the header a /style/ before the name. 


### Hosting with GitHub-Pages

GitHub has this awesome trick! If we change our main branch to a GitHub Pages branch and put a `index.html` file in there, GitHub will host our website!

1. Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
2. Then select the master branch source and click on the Save button.

Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io/repository.
Change the user-name in the link to your own GitHub user name and the repository to your repository name! 

Read more about it here:  https://pages.github.com/

### Editing the README.md

The README contains the text that is shown at the bottom of your repository. This usually contains a small explanation of what the repository is about and links to useful other sources.
Let's edit our README.md in the browser to customize it! 

2. Click on the README.md file and edit it by clicking the edit button.

3. In the README.md put the following:

	~~~
	# My First Web Map in Leaflet.js

	This repository contains the scripts and data for my first interactive web map.

	You can view my map <[HERE](http://username.github.io/repository)>
	~~~

Change the user-name in the link to your own GitHub user name and the repository to your repository name! 

4. Commit changes. 

### Now send the link to all your family and friends!
